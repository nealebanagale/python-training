Python's so-called magic methods
- set of methods that Python automatically associates with every class definition.
- classes can override these methods to customize a variety of behavior and make them act just like Python's built-in classes
- customize how your objects are represented as strings, both for display to the user and for debugging purposes.
- control how attributes are accessed on an object both for when they are set, and for when they are retrieved.
- add capabilities to your classes that enable them to be used in expressions such as testing for equality, or other comparison operations like greater than or less than
